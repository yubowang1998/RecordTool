# RecordTool

This is the recording software.
It allows to record synchronous video from a multi camera rig using Basler cameras and an Arduino for trigger generation.

## Installation guide
Select suitable release of Pylon's Python Bindings from:
    https://github.com/Basler/pypylon/releases

I chose 'pypylon-1.4.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl' because I want to use python3.6 and have a Linux machine with 64bit.

    pip install ~/libs/pypylon-1.4.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
    pip3 install scipy Pillow numpy opencv-python progressbar pyserial

Add your cameras to config/camera_names.py. This gives your cameras unique names. (we already did that for our cams)

## User guide

Start the RecordTool
    
    python3.6 run.py
